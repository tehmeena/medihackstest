-Maternal mortality is a major public health concern in Nigeria, with a significant percentage of deaths resulting from preventable obstetric causes.
-According to this study, top causes of maternal mortality include hypertension (27%), sepsis (20.6%), haemorrhage (17%), anaemia (3.2%), HIV (3.2%), and sickle cell disease (2.4%)...crucial need for comprehensive healthcare reform, better access to high-quality maternal healthcare services, and expanded public awareness efforts to address these preventable medical issues.
-Another study emphasises the need of resolving delays in maternal healthcare-seeking behaviour. Delays in seeking maternal health care, reaching a healthcare institution, and receiving expert pregnancy care were found as key factors contributing to maternal mortality.
-These delays are frequently caused by systemic difficulties, such as limited access to healthcare facilities, inadequate transportation infrastructure, and a lack of awareness about the significance of prompt and expert maternity care. 
-While preterm birth complications, intrapartum events, and infections account for over 80% of newborn deaths and stillbirths. Challenges impeding the improvement of maternal and newborn health are primarily attributed to inadequate access to quality healthcare services, poor health infrastructure, and a shortage of skilled health workers, as well as religious and sociocultural norms like early marriage and childbearing, gender inequality, and poverty.
-(PHCs) for pregnancy care among rural women in Nigeria, uncovering a range of contributing factors. These factors include accessibility issues stemming from poor transportation infrastructure and irregular facility hours, perceptions of poor quality care driven by various deficiencies in healthcare services, high costs of services, and the absence of partner support. Moreover, the study highlighted the critical need for effective strategies to promote male involvement in maternal healthcare
-Cultural beliefs and delayed healthcare-seeking behaviours, stemming from limited awareness about pregnancy and postnatal care, lie at the core of the distressing maternal mortality rates and preventable complications
-Despite the parents’ sincere efforts, they grappled with addressing their baby’s challenges and lacked comprehension of the situation, leading them to postpone seeking proper medical assistance for several weeks.
-Urban places with greater healthcare infrastructure have shown success, but rural and remote areas continue to confront obstacles.
-“Midwives Service Scheme” established in 2009,15 provided access to competent birth attendants in some areas but failed to overcome the urban-rural healthcare divide
-Some of the reasons behind the under-utilisation of primary health care (PHC) centres for skilled pregnancy care among rural women in Nigeria were uncovered through group discussions with married women and men . Firstly, accessibility factors included poor roads, transportation difficulties, long distances, and irregular facility opening hours. Secondly, perceptions related to poor quality of care include inadequate availability of drugs and consumables, abusive behaviour by health providers, insufficient numbers of providers, inconsistent availability of providers in the facilities, long waiting times, and inappropriate referrals. Thirdly, high costs of services played a role, including the inability to afford services even when costs were not high, as well as the introduction of informal payments by staff. Lastly, other factors included a lack of partner support and misinterpretation of signs of pregnancy complications.
-”Investing in research is critical to understanding the complexities of maternal and child health in low-resource settings and finding sustainable solutions that address the unique challenges faced by these communities.”

-Nigeria 
-Postpartum hemorrhage, commonest cause of severe bleeding, contributes to ¼ maternal deaths globally, Nigeria contributes 19% of global burden 
-”More people die more because of [poorer] quality of care compared to access to care” 
-”Ensuring medicine quality is critical…in reducing maternal deaths.” 
-”There is a need for the strengthening of regulatory frameworks and governance in the procurement of quality-assured maternal health medicines” 
-”procurement processes and policies for maternal medicines [must] be improved across states” 
“Facilities and pharmaceutical vendors and companies should work with states to effectively implement standard policies for the procurement of maternal medicines” 
-”Stakeholders involved in procuring and handling medicines must prioritize quality”

-”survey participants (49%) felt comfortable using a body measurement tool to monitor their body parts and 80% of interview participants were interested in using the body measurement to track leg/ankle swelling. Participants also shared additional pregnancy app features that they thought would be beneficial such as a “Digital Wallet” and a desire for a holistic pregnancy app that allowed for more continuous and personalised care.”
-”Research demonstrates that pregnant women frequently search the internet and use digital health tools such as apps to access pregnancy-related information”
-”Most pregnancy apps are primarily focused on providing educational information, and do not include self-monitoring features - even though there is evidence that these features can assist with behaviour changes that lead to improved healthcare outcomes”
-” recent study tested the feasibility of remote monitoring and asked pregnant participants to monitor their weight, heart rate, blood pressure, physical activity and sleep patterns daily using a smartwatch, a blood pressure machine and a scale alongside attending 4 in-person clinic consults. They found that home monitoring with devices alongside in-person consults was feasible21. Thus, there is an opportunity to develop a digital health intervention that integrates tools that allow self-monitoring of multiple health parameters with remote monitoring by and communication with healthcare professionals.”
-”Monitoring BMI as well as gestational weight gain (GWG) is now the standard approach to assess risk and provide recommendations to pregnant patients. However, other anthropometric and clinical parameters in addition to BMI and GWG are needed to help stratify disease risk as not all individuals are at equal risk of developing certain diseases such as GDM and preeclampsia33,34. For instance, a prediction tool for the early identification of GDM in pregnant women with obesity combined anthropometric measures with other measures such as blood pressure” 
-” All the interview participants that used pregnancy apps emphasized that the app user experience, interface, and customisability were important factors when deciding which apps to use:”
-”One of the more common reasons why interview participants reported not using an app to self-monitor their health during pregnancy was because they had been pregnant before and knew what to expect. However, interview participants who tracked a health condition during pregnancy tended to monitor their health more frequently, “…I have chronic hypertension. And I actually just wound up using a spreadsheet to track that” [IP 3]. Among the interview participants who used an app to monitor their health during pregnancy, four stated that the app chosen was not designed for pregnancy because they could not find pregnancy specific versions. These included Kegel exercise, diet, and calorie counting apps, “…All of the like health tracking…none of it has support for pregnancy, which is very annoying”
-”However, apart from using digital health tools, some women had reported that they have their own approaches to self-monitoring, such as note taking, their personal memory, photos, and excel spreadsheets. They used such self-monitoring methods to track health data such as, their blood pressure, blood glucose insulin, calorie intake, medications, physical activity, and symptoms. Another method of recording health data included activity trackers, which only 38% of survey participants reported using during pregnancy. Three quarters of those participants reported that they achieved their exercise goals more than once weekly using their activity trackers”
-”Some interview participants mentioned that they had surpassed their privacy concerns during the pandemic because of the unorthodox situations they had to face and because of their need for care and remote monitoring by healthcare professionals: “I worked with a lactation consultant when I got home from the hospital. And we had to do virtual appointments because of the pandemic. And that meant that I literally texted her on WhatsApp, like pictures of naked pictures of my boobs, which, you know, is not something that I would have opted to do if there hadn’t been a pandemic and I could have seen her in person…But because of the pandemic, I was like, “Great, I hope this doesn’t get hacked and leaked somewhere”
-asynchronys communication is helpful 
-”Several participants reported the difficulties they encountered during pregnancy when they needed to communicate with multiple healthcare professionals or specialists. One participant explained, for instance, how difficult it was to remember what their obstetrician wanted them to ask their endocrinologist and suggested how the communication between specialists could be bridged by digital health, “…My obstetrician is a bit old school, but he would often use a voice recorder and record his notes…Maybe something that could just capture a couple of points and then I could play that back to the endocrinologist or vice versa…I think that would be really useful.” 
-”Most of the interview participants (12/15) were interested in using the body measurement tool to track leg/ankle swelling: “
-”“Who keeps that information?” [IP 1]. When the interviewer explained that only the digital measurements extracted from their photos would be stored and used to train a machine learning system, and that they would choose who their data was shared with (family/friends/healthcare professional), participants reported that their concerns were alleviated. Similarly, 68% of survey participants responded “yes” to being comfortable with the use of their anonymised data [digital measurements extracted from photos] to train and develop the app technology while using the app (21% = I am not sure and 11% = No). In addition, survey participants were asked how interested they were to use an app that learns from their anonymous data (i.e., machine learning) to assist in the identification, prediction, and prevention of adverse health outcomes during pregnancy and there was moderate-high interest (76%) in using such an app. The interview participants that were not comfortable using a digital body measurement tool (20%, 3/15) had both privacy and body image concerns, “I think that would make me very uncomfortable…And I’d be worried about my privacy too” [IP 4]. In fact, when survey participants who responded “no” (28/106) to the question of being comfortable taking photos of their body parts regularly to extract digital measurements were asked to elaborate why, their explanations included discomfort/uneasiness, privacy/security concerns, body image/mental health issues, and credibility. In line with participants’ concerns around body image issues, one participant with a nutritionist background voiced their concerns about the lack of diversity of current anthropometric standards/guidelines, “What is typical? How do you come up with references or standards, when there’s this level of heterogeneity in body shapes and body types? And just in general, who stores fat where, you know, so for all you know its fluid accumulation, it’s fat, or they have goiter?” [IP 11] and, consequently, on the potential unindented yet negative consequences of the use of monitoring tools on pregnant women’s mental health.”
-”All the 15 interview participants mentioned that the educational information provided in apps or digital health tools could be improved. Some participants noted that more support and information should be provided about the initial stages of pregnancy, before their first pregnancy confirmation appointment at 8–9 weeks, and before their 20-week morphology scan. One participant explained the anxiety that they felt before their first pregnancy confirmation appointment, and how other users in a pregnancy app they used (Peanut app) felt the same need of support and reassurance. Four participants added how challenging it was to access guidelines that were pregnancy specific and that there is a need for credible information to help interpret health results. Aside from access to more pregnancy specific guidelines, there was a desire to learn more about how their bodies change during pregnancy outside of how their baby is developing.”
-”With regard to possible app features, many participants stated that they would find a “Digital Wallet” that stores copies of their medical data (such as resources provided by hospitals, pregnancy antenatal cards, receipts, scripts, and referrals) extremely helpful. One of the major factors that annoyed participants was that they had to carry physical scripts or referrals to appointments. Another additional feature many participants mentioned was a tool to track their symptoms during pregnancy. A participant who experienced severe morning sickness or hyperemesis gravidarum during pregnancy mentioned how difficult it was to track the number of times they vomited. In particular, two participants expressed that there is a current lack of support for pregnant women who are diagnosed with gestational diabetes and suggested that a gestational diabetes tracking tool should be developed.”
-”Several participants suggested that they would find a personalised list of appointments and appointment reminders useful because their busy schedule (due to their work and childcare responsibilities) makes it difficult to track their health appointments, as well as information about what to expect during those appointments.”
-“In terms of data sharing, participants indicated that they would not only like to share their data with their healthcare professionals, but with their family and friends using an export or share tool.”
-”better communication about potential postpartum complications should be encouraged.”
